Any lists in this <i>threats</i> directory of the repo, will be compiled and aggregated into the single file [aggregated-threats-1.txt](https://github.com/SystemJargon/blocklists/blob/main/lists/threats/aggregated-threats-1.txt)

 [aggregated-threats-1.txt](https://github.com/SystemJargon/blocklists/blob/main/lists/threats/aggregated-threats-1.txt) can then be used by things like AdGuard/AdBlock/dnsmasq - pi-hole or similar to block bad url/domains.
