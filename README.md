### Blocklists for bad domains.

Plain text format unless specified otherwise.

Commented lines use # (usually to describe what/why)


Source data comes from an array of discovery, detection and other work by myself and others.

### PLEASE DO NOT CLICK OR VISIT THE URLS OR DOMAINS IN ANY OF THE LISTS. THEY ARE ALL MALICIOUS!

For blocking adverts, telemetry and other crap, see my [Pi-hole](https://github.com/SystemJargon/pi-hole) or [AdGuardHome](https://github.com/SystemJargon/AdGuardHome) repo's.
