Plain text format lists, unless specified otherwise. Source data comes from an array of discovery, detection, aggregation and other work by myself and others. Commented lines use # (usually to describe what/why where and if applicable). 

Note: Example if using hosts format, the filename or directory will says "hosts" somewhere in it. 

The same applies for EasyList format which can use ```||``` per line/entry. I will say it's an EasyList formatted list.
