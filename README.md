Notes:

[Subdomains and Regex and formats](https://github.com/SystemJargon/blocklists/blob/main/subdomains-regex-formats.md)

Source data comes from an array of discovery, detection, aggregation and other work by myself and others. 

Commented lines use # (usually to describe what/why where and if applicable).
